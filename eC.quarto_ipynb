    "For selecting the two best prompts, I thought I needed to generate more than two prompts and evaluate them all against each other. For this step I asked ChatGPT-5 Thinking to generate 5 prompts for sentiment analysis. I actually had to try several prompts before I recieved an output I was happy with. I will include the other prompts in my AI appendix, but the following is the prompt that generated my sentiment analysis prompts.\n",

    "Would you develop 5 separate system prompts for testing sentiment analysis of tweets (positive, negative, or neutral) based on the most current and effective trends in prompt engineering and label the techniques used for each prompt in your output? I will be evaluating them against each other. The three options for sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) should be in the system prompt. I will be evaluating them in agenta.ai. The answer should should be written in lowercase and only include only the sentiment indicated no other text.\n",

    "- positive: praise, satisfaction, enthusiasm, gratitude, support, relief; \"not bad\"/\"could be worse\" treated as mildly positive; positive emojis (e.g., üòäüòçüéâ) weigh positive.\\\n",
    "- negative: complaints, frustration, insults, fear, disappointment, sarcasm with negative intent; negative emojis (e.g., üò°ü§ÆüíÄ) weigh negative.\\\n",
    "- neutral: mixed/ambiguous, info-only, questions without stance, jokes with unclear valence, news headlines, or contradictory cues.\n",

For each of these models I wanted to set the temperature to 0.2 because I wanted to configure that setting, but I didn't want to go to high and risk the possibility of hallucination when the output is meant to be simple. I also ran a prompt in GPT-5 to determine if I was on the right track. The prompt was:\n",

    "::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n",
    "In sentiment analysis (or any natural language classification task), the temperature setting usually refers to how deterministic or exploratory a model‚Äôs output is when generating text. Here‚Äôs how it applies:\n",
    "\n",
    "Low temperature (0.0 ‚Äì 0.3)\n",
    "\n",
    "Produces deterministic, stable outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Best for classification tasks like sentiment analysis, where you want consistent labeling (positive, negative, neutral) rather than creativity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: A sentence classified as \"negative\" will almost always get the same label.\n",
    "\n",
    "Medium temperature (0.4 ‚Äì 0.7)\n",
    "\n",
    "Allows slight variation in phrasing while still being mostly consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Useful if you‚Äôre generating explanations of sentiment (e.g., why a review is negative) and want a bit of variety in language.\n",
    "\n",
    "High temperature (0.8 ‚Äì 1.0+)\n",
    "\n",
    "Encourages creative, diverse outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not ideal for classification accuracy, since it may produce inconsistent or off-topic results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Better suited for creative writing, brainstorming, or exploring multiple interpretations.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Best practice: For sentiment analysis, keep the temperature at 0.0 or very close to 0. This ensures reproducibility and reliability, which is critical for analytics and downstream decisions.\n",

    "\n",
    "üîß Recommended Parameter Settings for Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "1. Temperature\n",
    "\n",
    "* Set to 0.0 (or very close to 0.1 max)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ensures deterministic and consistent outputs ‚Äî critical for classification accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Top_p (Nucleus Sampling)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Set to 1.0 (disable nucleus sampling).\n",
    "\n",
    "* With temperature already low, nucleus sampling isn‚Äôt necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This ensures the model always chooses the highest-probability class instead of exploring alternatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Max Tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "* Keep low (e.g., 10‚Äì20) if you only want the label (e.g., ‚Äúpositive,‚Äù ‚Äúneutral,‚Äù ‚Äúnegative‚Äù).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Increase (e.g., 50‚Äì100) if you want a short explanation of the sentiment along with the label.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Stop Sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "* Optional, but useful for clean results.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Example: If you want only one-word labels, you can enforce a stop token after ‚Äúpositive‚Äù / ‚Äúnegative‚Äù / ‚Äúneutral‚Äù to cut off extra text.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Prompt Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "* Provide clear instructions in the prompt to reduce variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```vbnet\n",
    "Classify the sentiment of the following text as strictly one of: Positive, Negative, Neutral. \n",
    "Text: \"The service was amazing but the food was average.\"\n",
    "Sentiment:\n",
    "```\n",
    "* With temperature = 0, this ensures very consistent and accurate labels.\n",

    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "My instincts about temperature setting for sentiment analysis were mostly correct (that temperature should be low), but ChatGPT was suggesting 0.0 which I thought was kind of boring so I decided to split the difference and go with 0.1 for temperature. I followed the other suggestions of setting Top P to 1.0 and Max Tokens to 10. I'm a bit curious about the Max Tokens setting because my earlier evaluations for the few shot and deliberate prompts had a mean token usage as 353 and 287 repectively. I didn't adjust the frequency or presence penalties because they didn't seem applicable to my evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Set-up tweak\n",
    "\n",
    "Well my intention was to use the ChatGPT suggested parameters, but I was having so much trouble with the outputs of Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro that I decided to forego max token limit and removed the parameter setting from Top P although a 1.0 seems to be neutral any how. I was receiving rate limit errors, or no output at all. I tried a lot of different configurations, but removing max tokens and the Top P parameter allowed the evaluation to run without error. I also adjust GPT-5 in this way. I kept temperature at 0.1.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Viewing all the results comprehensively, I am surprised to see that VADER, a tool engineered specifically for sentiment analysis, performed poorly, tied with my deliberate Claude Sonnet 4.5 prompt in Agenta.ai. Even though I didn't get any metrics for VADER on cost, tokens, or latency, I'm going to treat this like a grade in school and go ahead and consider anything below 70% a failure. This might have not been true even six months ago, but many of my prompts were performing well above this threshold. That being said, VADER and my deliberate Claude Sonnet 4.5 prompt are disqualified from the running.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the rest of the prompts evaluated I will prioritize the metrics in this order: accuracy, cost, tokens, and latency. Considering I'm not running an enterprise business, I'm not personally invested in how fast I can get the results. Obviously accuracy is pretty high on my list because it doesn't matter if the cost or tokens are low if the prompt doesn't produce accurate results. After accuracy, I am personally concerned with keeping costs low because I'm frugal and I don't want to toss cash at the businesses that are already swimming in it. After cost, tokens is a concern because I want to run energy effiicient prompts. Cost and tokens seem to be closely related anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking my priorities into account I'm going to declare the deliberate GPT-5 prompt as the winner and the few shot Claude Sonnet 4.5 prompt as the runner up. I recieved my few shot results first and thought that even though the Claude prompts accuracy was a bit low, the cost outweighed the accuracy compared to those results because the Gemini prompt had higher accuracy, but was much more expensive. However, the deliberate GPT-5 prompt had major gains in the accuracy department and even though it costs nearly $0.001 more than the Claude prompt, both of those numbers are so low that it doesn't break the bank. I'm also not planning on running thousands of sentiment analysis prompts personally. \n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt evaluation is an arduous multi step process. Even though this assignment was a lot more straightforward for me to complete than eB was, it still took me several hours to to compare all these prompts against each other. I only selected five prompts that were automatically generated by GPT-5, I can't imagine what this would have been like if I wanted to compare all of Schulhoff et al's 200 prompt techniques for sentiment analysis. It would have made this assingment a full time job. \n",
    "\n",
    "I'm surprised the deliberate GPT-5 prompt performed so well because I don't remember seeing that technique mentioned explicitly in Schulhoff et al's paper. However, after a quick Google search, it appears this technique combines a few powerful prompting techniques like chain of thought and self-critique. I also realize that I would probably never write a prompt like this on my own because it's very direct. I tend to try and be a bit polite when I write my own prompts. I did read that being polite can be useful in a post I read in the WhatIKnow doc. That being said, there did seem to be a lot more variation in accuracy between models with the deliberate prompt vs the few shot prompts, which basically had negligible variation in accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another observation I had was that Claude Sonnet 4.5 prompts tended to cost the least and use less tokens, followed by GPT-5 as a close second. However, Gemini 2.5 Pro was wildly inefficient when it came to cost, tokens and latency as compared to the other two models tested. I use Gemini frequently as a search engine because I like the UI. After comparing these metrics from my evaluation, I think I will start to use Claude more because it's more efficient than the other two popular models. Also, Claude only really performed poorly with the deliberate prompt, which I already mentioned I probably wouldn't write a prompt like that simply because it's not my style.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt evaluation wasn't really on my radar in regard to the world of prompt engineering before I started taking this class. Even though this process took a long time, I was happy to compare the results when I finally had them. I had an assumption that all three of the most popular models, GPT, Claude, and Gemini were basically the same and while many of the outputs tend to be similar, I don't often get to see what's going on under the hood when I use these tools. I'm happy to have had the opportunity to view these tools based on metrics I don't usually pay much attention to and it gives me a new perspective about viewing how these tools work holistically.\n",
